What Is Git?
------------

Git is a source control management tool. Basically it allows us to easily keep track of different versions of our application as we work. It also makes it easy to have multiple people working together on the same code and be able to combine all of our changes together.

We've already been using GitHub to get access to the code we have been using every week. GitHub is a web interface to code that is managed by Git. There are other similiar web interfaces such as BitBucket, but GitHub is the most popular. 

Getting Started
---------------

To learn the basic concepts of Git, check out the Treehouse lesson [Git Basics](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics).

Helpful Tools
-------------

Git is a command line application.  That's how I prefer to use it. If you would rather have a visual application to manage your Git repositories check out [Sourcetree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). It's free for Windows and Mac.
